# Architecture

The project is split into four independent layers.

## 1. Planner layer

The planner converts free-form user text into CircuitIR JSON. It may be GPT, Gemini, a local LLM, or any other model. The core generator must not depend on a particular model.

Input example:

```text
Make a voltage divider with 10k and 5k from VCC to GND and output at the middle.
```

Output: valid CircuitIR JSON matching `schemas/circuit_ir.schema.json`.

## 2. Validator layer

The validator checks CircuitIR before generation.

Responsibilities:

- schema validation
- duplicate component refs
- illegal net names
- unsupported components
- missing required values
- invalid or unsupported pin names
- topology sanity checks
- generation-readiness checks based on `knowledge/component_db.json`

The validator outputs `schemas/validation_report.schema.json`.

## 3. Generator layer

The generator is deterministic Python code. It consumes validated CircuitIR and emits a `.pdsprj` file.

Early strategy:

- use known-good Proteus 8.13 templates
- unpack `.pdsprj`
- build/update `ROOT.DSN` visual/topology data
- build/update `ROOT.CDB` component metadata
- copy `PROJECT.XML` and `SCRIPTS/PWRRAILS.DAT` from template, with optional timestamp updates later
- repack as `.pdsprj`

Initial emitted output domain: exact clean single-sheet template recipes. The first composition milestone is the structured AND reference circuit after D05-based validation.

### Component placer pipeline

The removal-only component placer now runs through the deterministic pipeline
used by the next native component route:

1. User input/CircuitIR validation.
2. Component placer.
3. Component packet validator.
4. Value changer.
5. Wiring planner.
6. Beautifier.
7. Final binary emission.

The current component placer keeps the accepted donor-packet emission path. It
does not synthesize terminals, wires, or cloned components. `SWITCH` and
`POT-HG` use exactly the requested packet count and are beautified through
their proven linked coordinate plans.

Each generated component-placement project writes a sidecar manifest:

```text
<output>.pdsprj.manifest.json
```

The manifest includes:

- `validation_reports`
- `value_plan`
- `wiring_plan`
- `layout_plan`
- `hidden_dummy_controls`
- `validation_reports.generated_output_validator`

The value changer now applies the first proven binary mutation path:
same-length selected-packet value-token edits, mirrored into matching CDB
property rows when the selected row contains the old value token. Current
proven families are `RESISTOR`, `CAP`, `CAP-ELEC`, `REALIND`, `POT-HG`,
`VSOURCE`, and `CSOURCE`. `VSINE` and `VPULSE` remain blocked for value
mutation until their property rows are decoded. The wiring planner emits net
intent only and never emits Proteus wire records.

The terminal placer now has an experimental all-family stage for appending
donor-derived `$TERBIDIR` records. It owns terminal naming, coordinates, and
left/right orientation. Its current `bbox_side_anchor_no_wire` policy does not
emit wire records or claim electrical attachment; donor-derived pin anchors and
short-wire packets remain the next required step.

Every stage must eventually provide both a direct stage-output validator and a
cumulative validator covering all accepted earlier stages. User-specification,
information-completeness, and final whole-project validators surround that
technical chain.

## 4. Feedback / knowledge layer

Human/Proteus test results are recorded using `schemas/test_result.schema.json` and appended to `knowledge/test_results.jsonl`.

Confirmed findings are promoted into:

- `knowledge/rules.json`
- `knowledge/authority_model.json`
- `knowledge/component_db.json`
- `knowledge/open_questions.json`

## Current maturity level

The repository contains a deterministic CLI, CircuitIR parsing and readiness
validation, fixture provenance checks, locked legacy circuit generators,
removal-only mega-donor component placement, family-specific coordinate
mutation, semantic project comparison, and result ingestion. Value editing and
all-family bidirectional terminal placement are experimental. Attached
terminal/wire composition and arbitrary unified-route wiring remain blocked
until donor-backed fragments pass Proteus 8.13 testing.
